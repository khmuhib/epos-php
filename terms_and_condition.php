                    govern all contracts for the supply of goods and/or software formed by our acceptance of a customer

                <p>1.2 The contract for our supply of Products to you (“Contract”) will be formed upon your acceptance
                    of our quotation or our acceptance of your order. However, we only agree to sell products to you
                    subject to their availability and accordingly the contract may be cancelled by us in writing without
                    liability to you if products cannot within a reasonable period be acquired by us for resale.
                    Acceptance of an order by us can only be made in writing whether in hard form or electronically.</p>
                <p>1.3 We may prior to accepting any order carry out a credit check and then will only accept your order
                    if we are satisfied with the results of such check. You confirm that you are happy for us to carry

                <p>1.4 These conditions may only be modified by a written variation signed by one of our directors. No
                    other action by us (including delivery of Products) is to be construed as our acceptance of any
                    other conditions, whether set out in your general conditions of purchase or in any other documents.
                </p>
                <p>1.5 These conditions together with any matters referred to on our quotation or order acknowledgement

                <br><b>2. WARRANTY</b>
                <br><br>
                <p>2.1 We warrant that goods will at the time of delivery be free from defects in workmanship and
                    materials and correspond in all material respects with the relevant product specification. If any
                    goods do not conform to this warranty then we will at our option either remedy the defect in
                    question, replace the defective Goods or refund the price of the defective Goods. This remedy is the
                    only remedy available to you for a breach of this warranty and is only available on condition that:
                </p>
                <p>2.1.1 you notify us in writing of the defect within 7 days of delivery or, in the case of defects not
                    apparent on reasonable inspection, within 1 month of delivery;</p>
                <p>2.1.2 defective Goods are returned to us within 7 days of written notification referred to in
                    condition 2.1.1 or, in the case of defects not apparent on reasonable inspection, within 3 months of
                    delivery; and,</p>
                <p>2.1.3 our examination of defective Goods at our premises discloses to our satisfaction that the
                    defect has not been caused by (a) your misuse, neglect, failure or inadequate maintenance, accident,
                    improper storage, installation or handling, or (b) repair or alteration by a third party. You will
                    refund to us the cost of any such examination where the remedy referred to under this condition is
                    not available together with, at our option and discretion, a “restocking fee” of up to 20% of the
                    price of the Goods to cover our administrative expenses.</p>
                <p>2.2 We will so far as we are reasonably able to pass on to you the benefit of all warranties received
                    by us from the manufacturer of the products.
                </p>
                <p>2.3 Where Goods are returned under condition 2.1:</p>
                <p>2.3.1 we will bear the cost of delivering any repaired or replacement Goods to you (subject to levy
                    of any repacking fee due under condition 2.4);</p>
                <p>2.3.2 the risk in the returned Goods shall pass to us upon delivery back to us of the relevant goods.
                </p>
                <p>2.4 Goods returned by you to us for any reason must be returned in their original packaging in
                    substantially the same condition as they were delivered to you and must bear a return identification
                    number clearly visible on the exterior (such number to be obtained from us prior to the return of
                    Goods by you). We will not accept liability for Goods returned without such identification number.
                    We may levy a fee for repackaging Goods returned to us in a poorly packaged state.</p>
                <p>2.5 Software (and its use) will be subject to the terms of the manufacturer’s license contained
                    within the software itself (and accessed upon loading) or within or upon the packaging of the
                    software. Such license will state the extent of the manufacturer’s liability for the software. We
                    cannot accept any liability whatsoever for any defect or error in the same other than where this has
                    been caused by our negligence or default.</p><br>
                <b>3. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b>
                <br><br>
                <p>3.1 Nothing in these conditions affects the statutory rights of a consumer as defined under the
                    Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. All conditions, warranties or representations not contained in these
                    conditions and implied by statute or law are excluded or restricted to the fullest extent permitted.
                </p>
                <p>3.2 This condition and condition 2 states our only liability to you under or in connection with the
                    contract.</p>
                <p>3.3 Without prejudice to condition 3.4, we will not be liable to you by way of representation (unless
                    fraudulent), common law duty or under any express or implied term of the contract for:</p>
                <p>3.3.1 any indirect, special or consequential loss or damage or loss of profits (whether caused by our
                    negligence or that of our employee’s agents or otherwise) arising in connection with the supply of
                    products and related services or their use by you.</p>
                <p>3.3.2 any loss or retrieval of data, it is your responsibility to keep adequate back-up copies of
                    data and programs held or used by you or on your behalf.</p>
                <p>3.4 Our entire liability in connection with the contract will not exceed the purchase price of the
                    products in question.</p>
                <p>3.5 Notwithstanding any other term of these conditions our liability to you for</p>:
                <p>3.5.1 death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or fraud or that of our employees,
                    agents or subcontractors; and,</p>
                <p>3.5.2 damage for which we are liable to you under Part 1 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 is not
                    limited save that this condition 3 shall not confer a right or remedy on you to which you would not
                    otherwise be entitled.</p><br>
                <b>4. PRICES</b>
                <br><br>
                <p>4.1 The price that you pay for the Products will be the price stated on our relevant quotation or
                    order acknowledgement (as appropriate) or, if no price is stated, our list price last published on
                    the date upon which Products are dispatched to you. We may at our discretion vary the price from the
                    price within the quotation or order acknowledgement only to the extent that the cost to us of
                    acquiring or supplying Products has increased between the date of quotation or order acknowledgement
                    and delivery of those Products to you, that being a result of (without limitation) increases in the
                    costs of carriage, packaging, insurance, or arising from a change in exchange rate, a change in
                    delivery dates, delivery quantities, or specifications for Products requested by you, or any delay
                    caused by our acting further to your instructions. Whilst you may sell the Products at whatever
                    price you deem fit, you will not advertise that price anywhere online including upon either your
                    website or a third-party website.</p>
                <p>4.2 Prices quoted by us are unless otherwise stated exclusive of (a) value added tax or any similar
                    taxes, levies or duties, (b) the costs of carriage, delivery, packaging and insurance, and (c) our
                    handling charges, all of which will be added to or charged on invoices at the appropriate rates and
                    paid by you.</p><br>
                <b>5. PAYMENT</b>
                <br><br>
                <p>5.1 Unless otherwise agreed in writing, you must pay for Products prior to their dispatch to you by
                    such means as we may notify you of. Where the Products are supplied on credit terms granted at our
                    discretion, payment will be made by you within thirty days of the invoice date. Payment by cheque is
                    deemed to have been made only upon such cheque being met on first presentation.</p>
                <p>5.2 Where any payment to be made by you under the Contract is not made by its due date then, without
                    prejudice to our other rights and remedies, we may:</p>
                <p>5.2.1 charge interest on the outstanding amount (as well after as before judgement) on a day to day
                    basis at the statutory rate from time to time applicable until the sum due is paid.</p>
                <p>5.2.2 withhold further deliveries, suspend performance of the Contract, cancel any credit terms
                    granted by us to you and/or withhold guarantees on previously supplied Products until arrangements
                    as to payment or credit have been established on terms which are satisfactory to us.</p><br>
                <b>6. TERMINATION</b>
                <br><br>
                <p>Where Products are to be delivered in instalments, each delivery constitutes a separate contract and
                    failure by us to deliver any one or more of the instalments in accordance with these conditions or
                    any claim by you in respect of any one or more instalments will not entitle you to treat the
                    Contract as a whole as repudiated.</p>
                <b>7. ACCOUNT OPENING</b>
                <br><br>

                    Each new client shall fill in the account opening form and provide the Company with a signed copy of
                    these terms and conditions, details of any relevant bank account and a blank copy of your
                    letterhead.</p><br>

                    quotation, as appropriate. Delivery will be made during normal business hours.</p>
                <p>8.2 Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, any delivery date or time specified by us in any
                    quotation, dispatch note or otherwise is a best estimate only and we will not be liable to you for
                    any loss or damage sustained by you as a result of our failure to comply with such time scale.</p>
                <p>8.3 If you pass or have a resolution passed for your winding-up, a receiver is appointed over the
                    whole or any part of your undertaking, an administration order is made against you, you enter into
                    or propose to enter into any arrangement with your creditors, become unable to pay your debts (or
                    have no reasonable prospect of so doing), suffer a bankruptcy order or commit a material breach of
                    the Contract, then we may without prejudice to any other right immediately terminate the Contract,
                    suspend or cancel further delivery and/or recover Products from you for which payment in full has
                    not been received.</p><br>
                <b>9. RISK AND TITLE</b>
                <br><br>
                <p>9.1 Risk in Products shall pass to you upon delivery.</p>
                <p>9.2 Title to Software shall not pass to you. Title to Goods shall not pass to you until their full
                    price and the price of any other goods which are the subject of any other contract between you and
                    us has been paid. Until title passes, Goods shall be: -</p>
                <p>9.2.1 stored by you at your premises in such a manner that they are clearly identifiable as being our
                    property and be kept separate from any other goods whether or not supplied by us;</p>
                <p>9.2.2 handed over to us on demand. We may re-take possession of such Goods and may enter onto your
                    premises for such purpose.</p>
                <p>9.3 If you fail to pay for any Products in accordance with these conditions we may bring action
                    against you for the price of the Products at any time notwithstanding that title in Products has not
                    passed to you.</p><br>
                <b>10. DAMAGE OR LOSS IN TRANSIT</b>
                <br><br>
                <p>We shall repair or replace, free of charge any Products damaged or lost in transit where delivery has
                    been made by our carrier, provided that you give us written notification of such damage or loss

                    carriage).</p><br>
                <b>11. APPARENT DEFECTS</b>

                    delivered in that consignment you may not reject that consignment and may only: -</p>
                <p>11.1.1 (if the quantity delivered exceeds the contract quantity) return the excess or retain the

                <p>11.2 These rights are only available however where condition 2.1 is also satisfied.</p>
                <p>11.3 You shall have no claim for the fact that Products delivered are of the wrong description unless
